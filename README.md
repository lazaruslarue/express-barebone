# node / express - api lecture

this lecture should help you all to begin understanding node & what it's strengths are.

we'll write some software that runs on node today, and i'll do a bit of live coding to help the process along.

- modules - http, fs, etc...

## express

express is a library written in node. it's helpful for making webservers, and provides a bunch of utilities to make your life easier

## api hacking

let's make an bookshelf API!
